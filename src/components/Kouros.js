    Kouros on PCH is the hottest nightclub in town. You can find it at the
    corner of Sunset Blvd and Broken Dreams. If you are looking for love, you
    are definitely looking in the wrong place. Greek gods, a cryptic cat,
    seduction, mystery, suspense…”Kouros on PCH” is a noir fantasy; a gripping
    tale about an affaire de coeur gone horribly wrong.
