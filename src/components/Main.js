    Rachel Tuchman Artenian grew up in Los Angeles,California. Her fondest
    childhood memories include dancing through the waves at Santa Monica Beach
    and reenacting Hollywood musicals on the steps of LACMA. Sadly, Rachel had
    to grow up and become a perfectly practical person. She attended UCLA and
    University of Chicago and got a real job wearing a gabardine straight-jacket
    and stiletto heels. After a few years, Rachel busted loose! She became a
    teacher, a mom, and a poet. Nowadays, when Rachel isnâ€™t touring school
    children through the Getty museum or writing silly stories, she can be found
    dancing the lindy-hop all over town.
